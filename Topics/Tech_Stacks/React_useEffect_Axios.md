## Introduction
This tutorial will provide a begginer friendly instruction to master React useEffect Hook and its application in software development. There will also be some real world examples demonstrating its power of api call execution. Specifically, we will be using the Axios, one of the most popular javascript Promise-based library for sending http request.

## What is “useEffect”?
In React.js, the functional components generally serve the purpose of rendering and displaying contents on the webpage. However, how are things such as asychronous API data fetching or conditionally updating the elements at any time (typically called “side effects” in most online resources) handled? The solution is “useEffect Hook”, an essential hook that frontend developers use to communicate with database or DOM.
