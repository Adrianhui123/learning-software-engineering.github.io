## Scrum Framework

### What is scrum?
Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams organize and manage their work. While most often used in software development teams, the framework can be applied to different sectors in HR, accounting and finance, etc. The term for this framework was coined from the 1986 Harvard Business Review article in which the authors compared high performing teams to the scrum formation used in rugby. Scrum specifiees artifacts, ceremonies/events, and roles associated with each sprint in order to get work done. 

### Scrum values
- Commitment
    - Team members should make sure to not overcommit to the amonut of work they can complete, and should be committed to their time-based tasks
- Courage
    - Team members should have the courage to question processes and ask open, challenging questions to anything that hinders the ability to move forward, and they should be met with open discussion
- Focus
    - The team must be focused on their selected tasks in order to complete the speccified work within a sprint
- Openness
    - There should be regular meetings, such as daily standups, to openly talk about progress and blockers
    - The team should be open to new ideas
- Respect
    - Everyone should recognize a team member's contributions and accomplishments
    - Respect for one another is important to ensure mutual collaboration and cooperation

### What are sprints?
A sprint is a short time period where the scrum team works to get a specified amount of work finished. Sprints usually correspond to some set of features a team wants to add. The goal of a sprint varies from team to team, some goals being a finished product that can be deployed to customers, other goals being to complete a subsection of a bigger product. The usual timeline for a sprint is two weeks, but differs between teams. 

### Members of a scrum team
A scrum team consists of three specific roles:
- Product owner:
    - The product owner is the expert on understanding the business, customer, and marketing needs
    - They focus on ensuring the development team delivers the most value to the business
- Scrum master:
    - The scrum master coaches the team and organizes/schedules resources for scrum meetings
    - Their goal is to optimize the flow for the scrum team, to ensure maximal productivity and minimal road blocks
- Development team:
    - The development team are the ones who work on creating the product/working on items in the sprint, according to the sepcifications from the product owner
    - The team consists of developers, UX specialists, Ops engineers, testers, and designers
    - With these differing skill sets, the team can cross-train each other to prevent any bottle necks

### Scrum artifacts
Scrum artifacts refer to the information a scrum team uses that detail information of the product being developed, the tasks involved in a sprint cycle, and the end goal. There are three artifacts:
- Product backlog:
    - The product backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done and is maintained and updated by the product owner or product manager
- Sprint backlog:
    - The sprint backlog is the list of users stories or bug fixes that ened to get done by the end of the current sprint cycle, and is chosen from the product backlog
- Increment (sprint goal):
    - The increment is the end-product from a sprint
    - This can mean a finished product, features usable to customers by the end of the sprint, or a completed section of a bigger project

### Scrum events/ceremonies
The scrum framework incorporates regular meetings, and events that teams perform regularly. In scrum, there are five regularly held events:
- Backlog organization:
    - This is the responsbility of the product owner, who makes sure to continually udpate and maintain the product backlog, according to feedback from users and the development team
- Sprint planning:
    - This meeting is led by the scrum master and includes the development team, where the items to be completed during the sprint are planned and added from the product backlog in accordance to the sprint goal
- Sprint:
    - This is the time period where the scrum team works to complete items in the scope of the sprint
- Daily standup:
    - The standup is a regularly scheduled meeting in which members of the team will update members on their progress and mention blockers they are facing with their work
- Sprint review:
    - This occurs at the end of the sprint, where the team meets to demo the end-product and showcase the completed sprint backlog items
- Sprint retrospective: 
    - Also occuring at the end of the sprint, the retro is where the team discuss the aspects of the sprint that worked, and parts that could use improvement
    - This builds in feedback and continual improvement of processes in the scrum framework

### Why is scrum important?
The scrum framework is used so often since it provides an efficient and adaptable way to organize and manage teams and products. This being a team centric framework, where the teams are self managed, it provides members the opportunity to be more creative and innovative, with flexibility to organize work based on their personalities and work styles. The framework provides concrete roles, events, artifacts, and values to follow. These asepcts of scrum are incorporated to professional workplace settings, and can be used in the 301 project as well to get the project done in the short amount of time given!
