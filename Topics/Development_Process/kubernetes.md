# Introduction to Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform that automates the management process for application containers. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Key Features

- **Auto Scailing:** Kubernetes automatically scales its resources dyamically to meet application's demand.
- **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes efficiently manages containers across multiple hosts.
- **Self-healing:** It automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces them, and kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks.
- **Load Balancing:** Kubernetes can distribute network traffic to ensure stability.
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:** Allows changes to the application or its configuration while monitoring application health.

## Components

1. **Pods:** The smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed.
2. **Services:** An abstraction to expose an application running on a set of Pods.
3. **Volumes:** Provides a way to store data and stateful applications.
4. **Namespaces:** Enable multiple virtual clusters on the same physical cluster.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications, providing efficiency and flexibility in application deployment and management.
