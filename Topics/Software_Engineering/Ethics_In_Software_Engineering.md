## Introduction
In the age of big data collection, it has become a continuously greater challenge to maintain ethical practices when designing software. It seems as though every company which collects user data or has any form of software which users interact with has made mistakes in this field, sometimes with catastophic consequences. Hence, it is vital for any software enginner to be mindful and educated on the topic of ethics in computing, and how they can apply it to their work.

## Why Does it Matter?
### Moral Incentives
An intuitive reason for taking into account ethics when designing software is general morality. Software that is designed without ethics and privacy in mind, even without the developer intending any harm, can have devastating effects for its users, as will be explored in the [Case Studies](#case-studies).
