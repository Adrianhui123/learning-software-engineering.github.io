## Scrum Framework

### What is scrum?
Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams organize and manage their work. It can be thought of a a way to implement agile principles. While most often used in software development teams, these principles can be applied to others teams in HR, accounting and finance, government projects, etc. The term for this framework was coined from the 1986 Harvard Business Review article where the authors compared high-performing teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams. Overall, scrum is for using a self-organizing team to deliver something valueable to customers in a specified time frame called a sprint. Scrum uses artifacts, ceremonies/events, and roles associated with each sprint to get the work done.

### What are sprints?
A sprint is a short time period where the scrum team works to get a specified amount of work finished. Sprints usually correspond to some set of features a team wants to add, completing specific product additions. The goal of a sprint varies from team to team, some teams having a finished product that can be deployed to customers, or the goal can be to complete a subset/section of a bigger product. The usual timeline for a sprint is two weeks but differs between teams.
