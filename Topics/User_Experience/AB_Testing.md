# A/B Testing

## **Introduction:**
A/B testing is a research method used to compare two versions of a web page or mobile app to determine which variation of the UI results in better performance. It allows individuals and companies to optimize user experience and make improvements to their application. 

## **Steps/How To:**
**Create Variation:** Create two versions of the applications UI to run the experiment on, whether it be changing font, colors, or re-designing the whole page. 
- The original page is known as the control.
- The altered page is known as the variation. 
**Running The Experiment:** Randomly filter the traffic of the application where one group (Group A) sees the original, or controlled version, and the other group (Group B) sees the modified version. 
**Collect Data:** Record and measure different metrics such as user session duration or other performance metrics related to the application.
**Analyze Results:** Based on the results, determine which version improves performance and deploy the winning variation. The experiment can be repeated to make further improvements.

## **Types of A/B Testing:**
**Split URL Testing:** 
- Split URL testing is a variation of A/B testing where two different web page urls are used, rather than running the experiment on the same url. Used for testing completely new page designs.
**Multivariate Testing:**
- Multivariate testing tests various changes to different page elements simultaneously to analyze which combinations perform the best. Can be used to save time rather than performing multiple A/B experiments.
**Multi-Page Testing:**
- Multi-Page testing tests changes to an element on the web page over multiple pages within the website. Allows for a consistent set of pages when testing variation with control.

## **Benefits of A/B Testing:**
- Optimizes user experience which allows you to create a more effective application.
- Can provide insights into user behavior which can help with product development.
- Quick and efficient way to test UI changes.
