## Introduction & Prerequisites
Framer Motion is a production-ready animation library designed for React. Framer Motion simplifies the process of adding animations by using unique components and props which act as an interface for adding animated properties to elements. 

This page will serve as quick, easy, and informative guide to getting started with the Framer Motion animation library. It will cover the first time installation and set-up of Framer Motion, foundational knowledge of animation components & props, an overview of a few key modifiable values, and a couple of quick tricks. A list of resources will also be included at the end. 

Before starting with the Framer Motion library, you should have some familliarity with React (specifically the use of [props & components](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)) as well as basic knowledge of CSS.

## Installation
Before using Framer Motion, you first need to have a React project set-up for you to add animations to. If you haven't made a React project before, you can follow the steps outlined in the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project). Now that you've made your React project, we can now add Framer Motion. To do so, we just need to install the Framer Motion package:

```
npm install --save framer-motion
```

And with that, you're already done the installation and can now start using Framer Motion!
