## Introduction
In the age of big data collection, it has become a continuously greater challenge to maintain ethical practices when designing software. It seems as though every company which collects user data or has any form of software which users interact with has made mistakes in this field, sometimes with catastophic consequences. Hence, it is vital for any software enginner to be mindful and educated on the topic of ethics in computing, and how they can apply it to their work.

## Why Should I Care?
### Moral Incentives
An intuitive reason for taking into account ethics when designing software is general morality. Software that is designed without ethics and privacy in mind, even without the developer intending any harm, can have devastating effects for its users, as will be explored in the [Case Studies](#case-studies) section.

### Professionalism
As a software engineer, you are personally and professionally responsible for maintaining a high level of quality in your work. The same applies to the level of transparency and privacy that you provide for your users. As you work with clients, you accept both implicit and explicit terms that include maintining confidentiality and privacy in order to protect their personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property.

### Legal Consequences
There are great legal implications to breaking ethical laws, and being unaware of them is seldom a reasonable justification. Violating the privacy of a user or otherwise handling their information irresponsibly can lead to lawsuits from that user, or from a client company. Poor practices can also result in detrimental fines and a ruined record; in the European Union, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is strongly enforced, and non-compliance can result in a fine of millions of dollars. The Canadian equivalent to the GDPR is PIPEDA.

## Case Studies
When evaluating the ethical quality of a service, we can typically look at three main factors: privacy, security and consent.

## Sephora
Multi-million dollar company Sephora is an example of a company which has faced legal consequences due to poor ethical practices related to software design. The problem with their software design is a concept commonly referred to in conversations surrounding ethics - "opt in vs. opt out". What this means is that, generally, if you offer a user a product or service, or wish to gather their consent for data collection, for example, they must be opted out by default, not opted in. That is, if your website has a check box which the user needs to have selected in order for you to use their data, that check box must be unselected by default.

In 2022, Sephora was found guilty of doing the opposite, opting users in to having their data sold by default. This resulted in a $1.2 million fine as an enforcement of the California Consumer Privacy Act.

## ChatGPT
On March 24th, 2023, it was revealed that Open AI's system had an easily exploitable vulnerability, allowing users to, through an open-source library called Redis, see the chat histories of other users. This same vulnerability was also responsible for allowing users to view payment information of other users, as well as their full names, email addresses and payment addresses. 

Open AI was thankfully able to detect this issue and take ChatGPT offline before it could impact any more than 1% of their users. However, with a large user base, 1% still implies many affected people, and this raises concerns for future problems as their user base only grows.
