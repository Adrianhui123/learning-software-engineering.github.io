# Handling Bugs and Technical Debt

## Introduction

Bugs and technical debt are inevitable aspects of software development. Properly managing and addressing these issues is crucial to maintaining a healthy and sustainable codebase. This page provides guidelines and best practices for handling bugs and technical debt effectively.

## Bugs

### Definition

A software bug is an error, flaw, failure, or fault in a computer program or system that produces an incorrect or unexpected result. Bugs can range from minor issues affecting user experience to critical problems that impact system functionality.

### Bug Life Cycle

1. **Identification**: Bugs can be identified through user feedback, testing, monitoring, or automated tools. Developers and team leads should foster a culture of reporting and documenting bugs.

2. **Prioritization**: Prioritize bugs based on severity, impact, and urgency. Developers should use a systematic approach, such as the MoSCoW method (Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves), to appraoch this.

3. **Assignment**: Assign bugs to the appropriate team member with the necessary expertise. Clearly communicate responsibilities and timelines to all members.

4. **Resolution**: Developers work on fixing the bugs. Developers should apply thorough testing to ensure that fixes do not introduce new issues.

5. **Verification**: Once fixed, bugs should undergo verification testing to confirm that the reported issue has been resolved.

6. **Documentation**: Document the bug, its resolution, and any insights gained during the process. This information is valuable for future reference.

### Best Practices

* **Encourage Reporting**: Create user-friendly channels for reporting bugs, such as a dedicated bug reporting tool or an email address. Provide clear instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

* **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing to catch bugs early in the development process. Continuous integration practices can help identify and fix issues before they reach production.

* **Regular Bug Triage**: Conduct regular bug triage meetings to assess and prioritize reported issues. This helps in managing the backlog effectively.

## Technical Debt

### Definition

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional work caused by choosing an easy or quick solution instead of a more robust and sustainable one. It accumulates when development teams prioritize rapid delivery over long-term maintainability.

### Types of Technical Debt

1. **Deliberate Technical Debt**: Intentional shortcuts taken to meet tight deadlines or to deliver a minimum viable product. This should be tracked and repaid strategically.

2. **Inadvertent Technical Debt**: Unintentional issues that arise due to lack of awareness, time constraints, or changing requirements.

### Managing Technical Debt

1. **Identification**: Developers should regularly assess the codebase for potential technical debt. Use code analysis tools to identify areas that may need attention.
