## Introduction

FastAPI is a web framework in Python for writing REST APIs. It is fast and easy to use, with type hints and automatic data validation. 

It also auto generates documentation for your APIs with the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications and with an UI such as [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/)

You can check out FastAPI's tutorials [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) at their own website with instructions on how to install FastAPI and how to get started with your first REST API using FastAPI
