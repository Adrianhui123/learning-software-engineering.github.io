Azure application service allows you to build and host web applications, mobile backends and RESTful APL in the selected programming language without managing the infrastructure. It provides automatic scaling and high availability, supports Windows and Linux, and supports automatic deployment from GitHub, Azure Devops or any Git repository. You can refer to our quick start, tutorials and examples to learn how to use Azure application services.

## Azure Terminology

- **Cloud Service Provider**: An organization providing cloud services, such as storage, security, databases, and  applications, typically appealing for its flexibility to pay only for what you use. Examples include Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

- **Resource Group**: A logical grouping of resources, typically by application, so pretty much a box of resources (ex. databases, storage, app service) that are grouped together for a solution or application.
