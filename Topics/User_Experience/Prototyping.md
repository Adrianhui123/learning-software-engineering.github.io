- **Layers Panel**: Understand how to organize and manage layers.
- **Properties Panel**: Learn to modify properties like color, typography, and effects.

### Step 3: Designing Frames
- **Create Frames**: Start by designing individual screens of your app or website.
- **Utilize UI Kits**: Speed up your design process using built-in UI kits.
- **Consistency with Components**: Create reusable components for consistent design elements.

### Step 4: Entering Prototype Mode
- **Activate Prototype Mode**: Switch from the design to the prototype tab.
- **Understanding Prototyping Tools**: Learn about interaction nodes and animation settings.

### Step 5: Linking Frames for Interactivity
- **Creating Hotspots**: Define interactive areas on your frames.
- **Linking Frames**: Connect frames to depict user flow and interactions.
- **Customizing Transitions**: Select from various animation options for smooth transitions.

### Step 6: Advanced Prototyping Techniques
- **Overlay**: Create modals, menus, or dialogs that overlay other frames.
- **Scrolling**: Implement scrolling to simulate long or wide content.
- **Device Frames**: Test your designs in specific device frames for realism.

### Step 7: Testing and Iteration
- **Preview Mode**: Use the 'Present' mode to interact with your prototype.
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct tests to gather user feedback.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine your prototype based on insights.

### Step 8: Sharing for Collaboration
- **Share for Feedback**: Easily share prototypes with team members and stakeholders for valuable feedback.
- **Collaborative Review Sessions**: Conduct live review sessions where team members can provide input in real-time.
