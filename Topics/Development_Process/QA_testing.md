## Introduction

This article will specifically focus on the testing portion of the development process. It is an essential and often overlooked part of this process and it will explain what software quality assurance or Software QA is, why it is an important part of the development process, how to do it and different methods of testing.
At the end of this article, a CSC301 student would have the basic understandings of Software QA and would be able to look into a career in the Software QA field.


## What is Software QA?

The following paper is likely the greatest paper about software QA, however it is very long. Here are some of the main definitions and key takeaways:
- In order to make sure the released software is safe and functions as expected, the concept of software quality was introduced. It is often defined as “the degree of conformance to explicit or implicit requirements and expectations”.
- The purpose of QA is to set up adequate processes, introducing the standards of quality to prevent the errors and flaws in the product. This is slightly different to testing where the purpose is to detect and solve software errors and flaws.
- There are different levels of software testing, component/unit testing, integration testing, system testing then acceptance testing.

This article gives a tease of what a software QA engineer is like, the different types of SQA engineers and their duties and responsibilities. It is the right article to figure out if you want a career in this field or you are interested in QA.

## Why should we test?

Testing is a vital part of the software development life cycle. This very entertaining video shows what events prompted the creation of software testing and how it has changed. It highlights the importance of software testing as far back as 1999 with the "Y2K" problem. Every software engineer should know about this.
