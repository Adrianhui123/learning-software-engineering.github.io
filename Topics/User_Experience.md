## Resources for User Experience domain

### Overview

User Experience (UX) is a large and broad topic. It covers the overall experience of the user and how they interact with software systems and applications. The main focus of User Experience is to make a piece of software accessible, easy to follow (ie: user-friendly) and adaptable to the user's needs. There is no set of standard rules that make up a "great" user experience, as it often differs on the product and the consumers that are using the products. User Experience is not to be confused with UI and UX Design. While these topics have similarities with User Experience, they are also different in their ways. For example, UI could be how the interface is designed whereas UX is more about how users interact with the said design. Many notable links are differentiating the two areas. Here is one of the related websites.
