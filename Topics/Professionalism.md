## Professionalism

# Importance of professionalism in software engineering

### Introduction to professionalism in software engineering
Professionalism in software engineering is a combination of technical expertise, adherence to ethical standards, and exhibiting behaviors that reflect positively on oneself and the software development community. It involves taking responsibility for one's work, communicating effectively, and continuously improving one's skills.

### Definition of professionalism
Professionalism can be defined as the conduct, behavior, and attitude exhibited by individuals in a professional setting. In software engineering, professionalism includes a range of behaviors that demonstrate a commitment to delivering high-quality work, effective collaboration, and maintaining ethical standards.

Also the definition of software engineering professionalism: Software engineering professionalism is a movement to make software engineering a profession, with aspects such as degree and certification programs, professional associations, professional ethics, and government licensing. (From Wekipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_professionalism)

### The role of ethics in software engineering
Ethics play a significant role in software engineering as they guide engineers in making responsible decisions that impact users, clients, and colleagues. Ethical considerations include data privacy, security, accessibility, and fairness, ensuring that the software development process benefits all stakeholders without causing harm.

### Examples of professional behavior and ethics

1. Adherence to coding standards: Consistently following established coding standards and best practices ensures that the code is readable, maintainable, and efficient.

2. Clear and concise communication: Effectively conveying ideas, requirements, and progress updates to team members, clients, and other stakeholders fosters understanding and collaboration.

3. Time management and meeting deadlines: Managing one's workload, prioritizing tasks, and delivering work on time demonstrates commitment and reliability.

4. Accountability and responsibility for one's work: Owning one's mistakes, learning from them, and taking necessary corrective actions reflects maturity and professionalism.

5. Collaborative and respectful teamwork: Treating colleagues with respect, actively listening to their ideas, and collaborating to achieve common goals contributes to a positive and productive work environment.

6. Continuous learning and skill development: Pursuing ongoing learning opportunities and staying updated with industry trends and advancements showcases dedication to one's craft and adaptability.

# Best practices for maintaining a professional demeanor in various situations

Professionalism is essential in all aspects of software engineering, and maintaining a professional demeanor across various situations is crucial for career success. Below are examples of best practices to maintain a professional demeanor in remote work environments and client interactions.

### Remote work environments
1. Establish a dedicated workspace: Create a separate, distraction-free area for work to maintain focus and productivity.
2.  Set boundaries: Clearly define your work hours and communicate them to your household members or roommates to minimize interruptions.
3. Maintain a regular schedule: Following a consistent routine helps manage time effectively and maintain work-life balance.
4. Stay organized: Use productivity tools like task managers, calendars, and note-taking apps to keep track of tasks, deadlines, and meetings.
5. Communicate effectively with team members: Utilize appropriate communication channels, provide timely updates, and engage in virtual meetings to stay connected and aligned with the team.
6. Invest in reliable technology: Ensure that your computer, internet connection, and other essential tools are up to date and reliable to avoid technical issues during work.

### Client interactions
1 Active listening: Pay attention to the client's needs and concerns, and ask clarifying questions to ensure a clear understanding of their requirements.
2. Professional appearance: Dress appropriately for video calls and ensure your background is tidy and uncluttered to present a professional image.
3. Setting realistic expectations: Communicate the scope, timeline, and potential challenges of a project upfront to avoid miscommunications and manage expectations.
4. Provide regular updates: Keep clients informed about project progress, milestones, and any changes or obstacles that may affect the project's outcome.
5. Delivering high-quality work: Strive for excellence in your work, thoroughly test your code, and address any issues promptly to ensure client satisfaction.
6. Handle difficult situations with grace: If conflicts or misunderstandings arise, remain calm, listen to the client's concerns, and work collaboratively to find a solution.

### Handling criticism and feedback

Before we begin, you should recognize that we deliberately chose to use the word “criticism” in the title of this section. We intend to get you to understand that the strategies we list below are not just applicable when receiving nice and polite “feedback” but also harsher “criticism.” The goal is to leave the critic (giver of feedback) with a better impression of you. This section is quite long because, arguably, the marker of someone with outstanding professionalism is that they are masters of managing criticism.

First, we should ensure our attitudes about criticism and feedback are proper. Understand that when a co-worker, client, boss, manager, senior developer, or whoever gives you criticism or feedback, they may not fully understand what they want you to do. In other words, treat criticism and feedback as an open conversation, similar to how we learned in lectures on how to build solutions for clients. When someone approaches you with criticism or feedback, they have a problem in mind for which their fix is not necessarily going to solve their problem. As a professional, it is up to you to determine the *exact* problem they have and to communicate with them to arrive at a solution that you can also be happy with (**this last part is super important!!!** Being happy with the solution will help you give off the impression that you genuinely cared about their opinion and are not just reluctantly resolving the situation). Once you’ve solved the problem and implemented the changes, go back and check to see if there are other areas of your code or your work where you can apply the same feedback.

1. **Ask for suggestions or examples of how to solve the issue when unsure of what feedback means or entails.** For example, suppose your boss tells you that you are not engaged enough in online meetings (vague!). Ask your boss for suggestions on how to be more engaged. Your boss might say they want you to talk more (still vague!), but at least you now sense what your boss means. Moving forward, you might want to say “Hello” to everyone when you join the call or give signs of affirmation throughout the meeting, such as nodding your head. You can then follow up with your boss to ask if they feel you have improved. If they say no, then you try something else and ask for more clarification until you’ve narrowed down what exactly was the problem and its corresponding solution.
2. **Avoid being overly defensive and overwhelmed by taking a step back if the criticism seems too harsh.** You can step back in various ways, but we recommend being honest and communicating that you need a few minutes to compose yourself. This pause will also give the critic time to adjust their tone and thoughts so that the conversation can be more productive and beneficial to everyone involved.
3. **Acknowledge valid points that the critic gives by stating what you agree with** (e.g. “I agree with you that this line of code here could be more readable”). Be very specific here so that there is no misunderstanding caused later on.
4. **Listen attentively**, especially when they can see your face and body. What this means is to ensure that your body or, at least, your head is facing them, and ideally, you will give signs that show you are following along, such as nodding your head and so on. However, the more important thing is that you are paying attention to what the critic is saying and thinking about how you will respond using the first three tips to guide what you could think about.
5. **Do additional research if necessary and fully understand the feedback before replying or making changes**, especially for code reviews. Consult with the reviewer in question and ask for feedback directly, which may be more helpful and faster. Especially for code, make sure to go back and check other code that you wrote to see if you can apply the same feedback and make improvements.
6. **Summarize the feedback once you’ve gone through all the steps and believe you have a strong understanding.** In your summary, go over the problems that you’ve identified and the solutions and fixes you’ve agreed upon. If the person who provided you feedback is happy with your summary, then you can now go ahead and make the changes.
7. **Bring in a mediator to sit in** if you feel that the critic does not want to have a productive conversation and is just personally attacking you. This mediator can be a co-worker, HR person, TA, etc.. The mediator should be someone who can calm the critic down and point out when either of you is making a comment designed to personally attack the other person. Make it clear when asking someone to be a mediator why you feel the need to bring them in.
