# Color Theory

## Introduction
The first thing that strikes you when you see an interface is most likely its color; you may find the color to be pleasant, or too loud and distracting. Color is a crucial aspect of any interface as it sets the tone, evokes emotions, and influences user perception. As such, the choice of color can impact usability and the overall user experience. With that said, there is a common misconception that the choice of colors for UI depends on the designer's aesthetic preferences and appeal. This article serves to debunk the misconceptions surrounding this notion and show that the decision-making process for generating and designing these visual elements has more layers to it than it seems.

## Importance of Color on User Experience
**Color psychology** is the study of how colors affect perception and behaviors, whether that be under the user's conscience or not. The moment our eyes perceive color, they connect with the brain which gives signals to the endocrine system to release hormones responsible for the shifts in mood and emotions; reseach has shown that it takes only 90 seconds for people to make a subconscious judgment about a product and between 62% and 90% of that assessment is based on color alone. As such, color psychology forms the basis of how designers choose colors for a product based on what we want to convey.

### Meaning of Colors and Association to Design
Every color is associated with it an emotion that it elicits. In this documentation, I will only cover the 6 main colors - red, yellow, green, blue, black, and white. 
* **Red**: evokes passionate, powerful, or intense emotions and is linked to both positive and negative states of mind, such as love, confidence, passion, and anger. In design, incorporating red can effectively capture users' attention. However, red should be used in moderation to prevent potential adverse reactions.
* **Yellow**: evokes inspiration and confidence and is the easiest color to visibly see. Yellow is also known as the color of happiness which symbolizes joy and warmth, serving as a powerful psychological cue. In design, too much yellow could bring negative reactions of feeling of anxiety or fear.
* **Green**: evokes calming and renewing energy, as it is a color that symbolizes nature, growth, and harmony. Green also evokes envy and jealousy, as it is associated with notions of wealth and materialism. In design, the context should be considered when using green in combination with other colors.
* **Blue**: evokes feelings of trust and reliability. In design, it can be used to convey trust but should be incorporated in moderation as it also associates with feelings of distance and sadness.
* **Black**: has many meanings; it is associated with mystery, death, and can convey meanings of tradition, seriousness, or moderness. Context and color combinations determine the vibe it gives off. In design, black goes well with everything hence is largely used as background color. It is also often used to set contrasts.
* **White**:
