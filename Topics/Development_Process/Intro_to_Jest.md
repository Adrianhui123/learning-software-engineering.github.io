## 1. What is Jest?

### Introduction to Jest
Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook/Meta for React, but it can be used for any JavaScript project. Jest focuses on simplicity, speed, and a developer-friendly testing experience. It comes with built-in functionalities like test assertion, mocking, and code coverage, making it a comprehensive solution for testing JavaScript code.

### Why use Jest for testing?
Jest provides several advantages for developers engaged in testing their applications:

- **Zero Configuration:** Jest requires minimal setup, and in many cases, no configuration is needed out of the box.
  
- **Fast and Parallel Testing:** Jest is optimized for speed, allowing developers to run tests in parallel, significantly reducing test execution time.

- **Built-in Mocking:** Jest simplifies the process of mocking dependencies, making it easier to isolate and test components or modules.

- **Snapshot Testing:** Jest introduces the concept of snapshot testing, which enables capturing and comparing snapshots of rendered components, aiding in identifying unexpected changes.

- **Excellent Documentation and Community Support:** Jest has extensive documentation, and being widely adopted, it benefits from an active community, ensuring that developers can find help and resources easily.

## 2. Installation & Setup

### System Requirements
Before installing Jest, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js:** Jest requires Node.js to run. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installing Jest
#### Using npm
To install Jest for your project using npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```
#### Using Yarn
If you prefer Yarn as your package manager, you can install Jest with the following command:

```bash
yarn add --dev jest
```

### Configuring Jest for your project
For the purpose of the guide, we will use Jest with its default configuration. For more customized setups, you can create a `jest.config.js` file in your project's root directory. 

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Your Jest configuration options go here
};
```
