##Lean Software Mehodology
### What is Lean?
Lean is an ideology that originated from the manufacturing principles of a car company in Japan, namely Toyota which integrated its way into the software development process. The key idea in Lean is to remove waste in the production process to optimize efficiency and produce a high value product to the customer. 

### High Overview of Lean Development Flow
1. Identify the value
   - What is your customer looking for? The first step to the Lean Development process is to precisely define what the customer values. This allows the development team to solely focus on exactly what matters most to the customer and allows the team to identify which ideas or features would be considered a waste of time and energy.
2. Map the value stream
   - Now that we know what the customer values, how will we achieve this goal? Identify every step in the development process and determine the value of each step. This allows teams to see an overview of what work must be done before moving on to the next step and helps in pointing out possible bottlenecks and major delays in their development process.
3. Create flow
   - Next step involves creating a flow with minimal delays. This flow must be continuous flow of value meaning that at every moment in the development process there is something being done to achieve the customer's wanted value. Practically speaking this includes removing any delays or minimizing batch processes. This kind of flow also aligns well with the customer's demand because there will always be an effort in building a minimal viable product (MVP).
4. Establish pull
   - Pull refers to the customers demand. The development team only responds to customer's demands and work is only initiated on these demands. This reduces production of an uneeded product or feature, saving time and money.
5. Seek perfection
   - The continual desire to improve the product for the customer. Practically speaking this looks like constantly reassessing the work done, asking for feedback and making improvments on those feedbacks.
