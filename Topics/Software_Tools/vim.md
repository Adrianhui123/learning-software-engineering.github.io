# Introduction to Vim

## Introduction


### What is Vim?

Vim, short for Vi Improved, is a light-weight, customizable and powerful text
editor that comes with most UNIX-like operating systems (Linux, BSD, macOS).
What separates Vim from other text editors and IDEs is it's unique methods of
traversing text files and making edits, all without the need for using your
mouse.  In addition, Vim runs entirely within the terminal, meaning it has a
smaller memory footprint and generally runs faster than something like VSCode.

### Why Vim?

One of the strongest arguments against using Vim over something like VSCode is
that Vim has a steep learning curve. While it is true that Vim has a steeper
learning curve, learning the basics of navigation and editing with Vim is not a
complicated task. Furthermore, knowing how to use Vim can be a useful skill on
the job. For instance, when working with remote machines, you will often need to
edit things like system configuration files, systemd services etc. Furthermore, you'll
often have to SSH into them from the terminal, meaning you won't have access to other
editors, only Vim.
