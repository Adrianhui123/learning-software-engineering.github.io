## User Stories

### Introduction
A user story can be described as an information explanation of a new feature or task in a software project. The purpose of a user story is to gauge how the particular feature will provide value from the perspective of the user. User stories therefore exist to organize and structure a large set of tasks in user-centric manner.

<!-- User stories generally exist in collections, and create the foundation of larger frameworks (such as epics, initiatives or MVPs).  -->

### Structure

```
As a <role> I can <action>, so that <receive benefit>
```

### Acceptance Criteria
