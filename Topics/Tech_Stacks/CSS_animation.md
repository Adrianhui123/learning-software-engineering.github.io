## Introduction

Native CSS has built in animation functionality which can be used to implement web page animations (i.e. on HTML elements) without the use of JavaScript. There are three key advantages to using CSS animation rather than traditional script-driven animation techniques:
1. They easy to use for simple animation; does not require knowledge of JavaScript
2. CSS animations run well even under moderate system load (simple animations can still perform poorly in JavaScript under a similar load)
3. CSS animations are controlled by the browser, allowing the browser to optimize performance and efficiency (ex. the browser may reduce the update frequency of animations running tabs that are not currently visible)

At its essence, CSS animations are transitions, and we can describe them as a 'change from one CSS style to another over the dimension of time'. 

## Using CSS Animation

There are two main parts to CSS Animation:
1. 'animation' properties: these are CSS element properties that allow you to style the animation of that given element
2. '@keyframes' rules: allow you to define animations
