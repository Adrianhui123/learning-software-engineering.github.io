# Firebase and Firestore


## This post will be about setting up Firebase and utilizing Firestore:


## Introduction:
Firebase is an all in one platform that hosts a myriad of services that cover the development cycle of an application. It includes services such as analytics, authentication, and for what we will be covering, database management.

Firestore is a NoSql document database, this means that data is structured hierarchically within collections.


## Setting up Firebase for a Web Application :
1. First, create a firebase project and register that app w/ the project.
2. Once registering is done you'll get a firebase config object to connect your app with firebase reasources
3. In the firebase console follow the installation steps to create a new project
4. For App registration:
- In the Firebase console's project overview page, click the </> icon to set up, then enter the App's name and follow the instructions to add and initialize Firebase SDK int eh app
5. SDK initialization
- First do: npm i -g firebase-tools or npm i -D firebase-tools (as a dev tool) in your projectâ€™s terminal
- Next type npx firebase login, this will open up a browser to login with your firebase account
- Next, type npx firebase init hosting to begin the project setup process
- Next, follow the installation steps displayed in the terminal and choose the options you desire


## Setting Up Firestore 
1. Before using in your app, go to the firebase console go to build > Firestore database > Create database >start in test mode >next 
2. Add the following scripts in your app:
```
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.6.0/firebase-app-compat.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.6.0/firebase-firestore-compat.js"></script>
```
3. Install firebase if not already with this command in your terminal:
```
npm install firebase@10.6.0 --save
```
4. Manually import firebase and firestore at the top of the file in your code
```
import firebase from "firebase/compat/app";
