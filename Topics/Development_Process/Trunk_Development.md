### Trunk-Based Development

Knowing how to manage the creation of large new features in your repository is an important skill, especially working in large organizations or on projects with a complete CI systems. It can be tempting to have large feature branches with hundreds of new lines of code and it can seem daunting to implement a large feature in small stages. Trunk-based development is a system to handle large changes like this. It focuses on creating small PR and using tools such as feature flags. The following article from Atlassian does a great job discussing all the benefits of trunk-based development (i.e. impact on automated testing, having less active branches, and more): **[Atlassian Article](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)**

Instead of using feature flags, one can also use the "branch by abstraction" method found in [this article](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-by-abstraction/). This is similar to referencing an interface instead of a class and much like dependency inversion, can both increase or reduce the complexity of your code.
