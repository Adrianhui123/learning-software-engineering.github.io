## Introduction
[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free and lightweight yet powerful code editor popular for its versatility, user-friendly interface, and extensibility. 
VS Code meets the diverse needs of software engineers across different languages and frameworks and offers a variety of features to boost programmer productivity, whether you’re an experienced software engineer or a student starting the journey. 
In this article, we will go over the installation and setup, and explore features like debugging, git integration, and extensions, that make VS Code an all-in-one editor.

## Installation and Setup
Clicking on [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) link will take you to the download page where you will be able to select your operating system and download the latest version. 
After the download is complete, you can open the downloaded file to launch the installer and follow the instructions. 
Once you have completed the installation and launch VS Code, you will be greeted by the following screen. 
So, let the adventure begin.

## Top Features

### [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)
An umbrella term for various code editing features, IntelliSense simplifies the coding process by providing code completion, syntax highlighting, Code Actions, and parameter info, among many other useful features.

These editing features work together to simplify your coding experience. You can learn more about IntelliSense [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense).


### [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) with VS Code
VS Code’s in-built debugger provides a robust and seamless debugging experience. 
It allows you to easily set breakpoints and use the debugger interface to step through and examine the execution (including the variables and the stack) thoroughly.


Depending on the language you are using, when you run the debugger, you will be prompted to select or install the debugger for that language. 
Once selected, you will be well-equipped to find those pesky bugs that have been hiding in plain sight!

The debugger’s intuitive and easy-to-use interface allows you to set breakpoints by clicking beside the line number and investigate the state of the execution. 


Here is a short video that shows the debugging process for a small Python program using the VS Code debugger:


The debugger also offers a variety of breakpoint options including but not limited to conditional (only breakpoint), function (easily select functions to breakpoint on), and even in-line breakpoints (breakpoints that let you control the flow of execution up to the granular level). 
You can find these breakpoints and other debug-related settings by going under the Run menu and clicking New Breakpoint (on both Windows and Mac).
