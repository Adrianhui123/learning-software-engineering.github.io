## Introduction 
Let's be honest, I'm fairly certain most of you reading this know what ROBLOX is. In certain corners of the internet it's renowned as "the funny lego game" and is the source of many memes and cursed images.

But in case you didn't know, ROBLOX is a multi-billion-dollar platform that lets users create their own games (dubbed "experiences") in their own engine, which can then be uploaded to the ROBLOX website for all to see. Users can also create their own avatars that they can play as in these games.

It's kind of like Scratch (come on, you've gotta know what that is!), but instead of making projects by dragging and dropping code blocks, ROBLOX uses a full-on scripting language they call [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/).

At first glance a lot of people may dimiss ROBLOX as not being a "real" game engine, mostly due to the blocky style that most games have:

*Me having a chat with an NPC in "Work at a Pizza Place"*

*Me on a rubber duckie in "Natural Disaster Survival"*

But the truth is, ROBLOX really is capable of some awesome things:

*One of my theme parks in "Theme Park Tycoon 2", featuring a coaster builder that can rival that of Planet Coaster (believe, I've tried both!)*
