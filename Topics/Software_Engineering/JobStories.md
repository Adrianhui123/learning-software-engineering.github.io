## Job Stories

### Introduction

- how are job stories used in development??
  
When developing a product job stories are used to determine how to design the product.

- what are job stories?
  
Job stories express the user's need for using the product. For example, .. company wanted to improve their milkshake sale's. They tried refining the milkshaek formula, more adversting but none of it worked. Because they didn't think why user's needed the milk shake what job was it hired to do.

describe what a product is "hired" to do.

Job Stories, as the name implies, put the user’s job at the center of the story. In JTBD theory a job is a complex entity describing what user is hiring the product to do. The job is described in context having functional, emotional, and social aspects.

In it simplest form a job story looks like this:

When [situation] ,
I want to [motivation],
so that I can [expected outcome].

And to use a practical example:

When I am at McDonald’s,
I want to buy a milkshake,
so that I can stay awake while driving.

  - the type of user is based on a persona
  - we make aassumption of features / goals that they user want when we don't know if that is what they really want
  - never explain why people want to do something
  - Personas are imaginary customers defined by attributes that don’t acknowledge causality.

These attributes, generally in the form of demographics, do not bring a team closer to understanding a customer’s consumption, or non-consumption, of a product. The characteristics of a Persona (someone’s age, sex, race, and weekend habits) does not explain why they ate that Snickers bar; having 30 seconds to buy and eat something which will stave off hunger for 30 minutes does explain why.
implementation was coupled with motivations and outcomes.
