# JSON-RPC

## Introduction
JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. Like REST, it is used for API calls, but there are also differences. JSON-RPC focuses on remote procedure calls whereas the more popular REST is more focused on resource manipulation. JSON RPC 
has better security because the procedure is masked, so the only thing that is exposed is the endpoints.
