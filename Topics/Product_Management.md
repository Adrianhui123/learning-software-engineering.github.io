## User Stories

### Introduction
A user story can be described as an informal explanation of a new feature or task in a software project. The purpose of a user story is to gauge how the particular feature will provide value from the perspective of the user. User stories generally exist in a set amongst other user stories, and allow teams to organize and structure a large set of tasks in user-centric manner.

### Structure

The majority of user stories are written to follow a general outline or pattern. The most commonly used format is the [Connextra Template](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories), which is outlined below:
```
As a <type of user>, I want <some goal>, so that <some reason>
```
An alternative structure which makes use of W5 can be found below:
```
As <who> <when> <where>, I want <what> because <why>
```
There is no strict benefit to using one format over the other. There are many other popular formats, that each bring different value to different teams.

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria refers to a list of requirements that must be acomplished for a user story to be completed and closed. The purpose of acceptance criteria is so user stories can be fully scoped, so that developers understand the expected output and so that all stakeholders to be satisfied.
