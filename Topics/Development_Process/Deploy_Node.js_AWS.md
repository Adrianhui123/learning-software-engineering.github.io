# Node.js Deployment through Docker and AWS

## Overview
In the realm of modern software development, containerization has become a standard practice for deploying applications. Docker simplifies this process by packaging applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across various environments. Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime, is often used to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a suite of cloud services that enable developers to deploy and manage applications easily. ECS (Elastic Container Service) and ECR (Elastic Container Registry) are two fundamental services offered by AWS to manage containers and container images, respectively.

## Tech Stack

Docker: Docker is a platform that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. It provides isolation, portability, and scalability for applications. It allows for easy deployment as it essentially creates a separate virtual machine to run the application on.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment which is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service): ECS is a fully-managed container orchestration service provided by AWS. It allows you to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances easily.

Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry): ECR is a managed Docker container registry provided by AWS. It allows you to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images, making it easy to integrate with ECS for container deployments.

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): EC2 is AWS's resizable cloud computing service offering virtual machines (instances) for running applications. It provides flexibility to configure and scale computing resources based on demand.
