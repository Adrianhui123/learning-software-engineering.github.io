# Building Apple Native Software Using Swift and SwiftUI
Swift is a modern, open-source programming language developed by Apple as a replacement to their earlier language, Objective-C.

It can be used on Mac devices to develop software that target all Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, while being deeply
integrated into Apple's IDE: Xcode.

## Why Use Swift?
While languages such as React Native allow you to build multi-platform apps, such as for iOS and Android, using only one source code,
Swift offers many tools that make it easy to quickly build apps that work specifically throughout all of Apple's ecosystem of platforms.

Apps built through Swift can intuitively [support iPhone and iPad screens at the same time](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=nixcb564),
utilizing design patterns and themes that fit Apple's design policy to match the expected user experience on an iOS device.

You will have access to an [assortment of developer kits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologies?input=kit) that make
it simpler to integrate various, native features into your app. For example, [WidgetKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WidgetKit)
can help set up widgets for iOS Home Screens for your app, or [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit) can allow you
to communicate to a user's health and fitness data, with their permission.
