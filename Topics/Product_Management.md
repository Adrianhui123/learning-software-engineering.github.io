## User Stories

### Introduction
A user story can be described as an information explanation of a new feature or task in a software project. The purpose of a user story is to gauge how the particular feature will provide value from the perspective of the user. Therefore, user stories exist to organize and structure a large set of tasks in user-centric manner.

<!-- User stories generally exist in collections, and create the foundation of larger frameworks (such as epics, initiatives or MVPs).  -->

### Structure

<!-- The majority of user stories follow a standardized pattern which is outlined below:
```
As a <role> I can <action>, so that <receive benefit>
``` -->
