## Introduction
<a id='introduction'></a>
This document provides introduction to QRcode with guidelines and examples to create QRcode with python library qrcode.

## What is REST?
<a id='what-is-QRcode'></a>
**quick-response code (QRcode)** is is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode, which can be read by an imaging device, such as a camera, and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both the horizontal and the vertical components of the QR image.


## qrcode library
<a id='qrcode_library'></a>
** The Python QR Code library is a versatile and easy-to-use tool for generating QR (Quick Response) codes in Python applications. QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data, such as alphanumeric characters, binary, and numeric data. This library provides a simple interface for creating QR codes, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to incorporate QR code generation into their projects.

### Features

- **Ease of Use**: The library offers a straightforward API, allowing developers to generate QR codes with just a few lines of code.
- **Customization**: Users can customize various aspects of the QR code, including size, color, error correction level, and more.
- **Support for Multiple Data Types**: The library supports encoding various data types, such as URLs, text, contact information, and more.
- **Error Correction**: QR codes generated by the library include error correction to ensure reliable scanning, even if the code is partially damaged or obscured.

### Installation

To use the Python QR Code library, you can install it using the following pip command:


        pip install qrcode[pil]



## example
<a id='example'></a>
        import qrcode

        # Create a QR code instance
        qr = qrcode.QRCode(
            version=1,
            error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L,
            box_size=10,
            border=4,
        )

        # Add data to the QR code
        data = "Hello, World!"
        qr.add_data(data)
        qr.make(fit=True)

        # Create an image from the QR code
        img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")

        # Save the image
        img.save("hello_world_qrcode.png")
