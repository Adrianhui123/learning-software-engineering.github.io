## What is Navigation Design ?
Navigation Design, also referred to as menu design, helps users to easily move through the pages of your website. It utilizes design techniques to allow ease of navigation and provide the user a better user experience. 


## Good vs Bad Navigation Design 
Good navigation design allows the ease of finding information and is intuitive and easy to use. On the other hand, bad navigation design can overwhelm the user and make finding important content difficult.  As a result,  it is important to keep the user in mind when designing the navigation of a website, especially complex websites with a multitude of pages. In fact, reasoning about how the user can navigate through the many pages of a website and efficiently within a large page can help lay the foundation to good navigation design. 

Consider using the following steps to start thinking of good navigation design  : 

1. Layout all the pages on your website
    * This can be done on paper or through a design tool such as Figma[https://www.figma.com/]
      
2.  Find relevant ways a user may navigate through those pages 
     * For example, home page → sign in → back to home page
     * Additionally, consider using prototyping or wireframing to give yourself a clearer picture on how the user may navigate through your website
       
3. Determine which pages the user may need to reference most often
    * For example, the home page / landing page is usually referenced a lot by the user.
        
4. Consider using some of the following to ease navigation through the website :  
    * Navbars
        * Usually at the top of a landing page / home page. These contain links to the website's main pages
    * Side menus
        * Usually located at the side of the page and contains links to relevant pages on the website 
    * Tabbed menus
        * Organizes information into different tabs, where each tab contains different relevant information
    * Footers containing links to all relevant pages within your website 
        * Usually at the bottom of a page. It can contain links to all pages on the website as well as contact information
          
5. Consider how the user may navigate through the content on a single page.
   * Sub-navbars can be utilized
        * Located below a normal Navbar and  consists of links that are relevant to the specific page that the user is on 
    *  If there is searchable / filterable content on this page, consider using icons that are easily identifiable by the user as  search  ( magnifying glass) or filter
