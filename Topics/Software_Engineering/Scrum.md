## Scrum Framework

### What is scrum?
Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams organize and manage their work. It can be thought of a a way to implement agile principles. While most often used in software development teams, these principles can be applied to others teams in HR, accounting and finance, government projects, etc. The term for this framework was coined from the 1986 Harvard Business Review article where the authors compared high-performing teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams. Overall, scrum is for using a self-organizing team to deliver something valueable to customers in a specified time frame called a sprint. Scrum uses artifacts, ceremonies/events, and roles associated with each sprint to get the work done. 

### Scrum values
- Commitment
    - Team members should make sure to commit to the right amount of work they can complete, and not overcommit
    - They should be committed to their time-based tasks
- Courage
    - Team members should have the courage to question processes and ask open, challenging questions to anything that hinders the ability to move forward, with open discussion
- Focus
    - The team must be focused on their selected tasks in order to complete the speccified work within a sprint
- Openness
    - There should be regular meetings, such as daily standups, to openly talk about progress and blockers
    - The team should be open to new ideas
- Respect
    - Everyone should recognize team member's contributions and accomplishments
    - Respect for one another is important to ensure mutual collaboration and cooperation

### What are sprints?
A sprint is a short time period where the scrum team works to get a specified amount of work finished. Sprints usually correspond to some set of features a team wants to add, completing specific product additions. The goal of a sprint varies from team to team, some teams having a finished product that can be deployed to customers, or the goal can be to complete a subset/section of a bigger product. The usual timeline for a sprint is two weeks but differs between teams. 


### Members of a scrum team
A scrum team consists of three specific roles:
- Product owner:
    - The product owner is the expert on understanding the business, customer and marketing requirements
    - They focus on ensuring the development team delivers the most value to the business and understand the changing needs of user and customers the best
- Scrum master:
    - Scrum masters coach team and organize/schedule resources for scrum meetings 
    - Their goals is to optimize the flow for the scrum team to ensure maximal productivity and minimal road blocks
- Development team:
    - The development team are the ones who work on creating the product/working on items in the sprint, according to the specifications from the product owner
    - The development team consists of developers, UX specialists, Ops engineers, testers, and designers
    - The members of the development team have different skill sets and will cross-train teach other to prevent any members becoming a bottle-neck

### Scrum artifacts
Scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team uses and refers to that details the product being developed, the specific tasks involved in a sprint cycle, and the end goal. There are three artifacts:
- Product backlog:
    - The product backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done and is maintained by the product owner or product manager
    - It functions as a big to do list that is adaptable to adjustments and changes over time
- Sprint backlog:
    - The sprint backlog is the list of user stories or bug fixes that need to get done by this current sprint cycle
    - The sprint backlog is planned thoroughly before each sprint and is chosen from the product backlog
- Increment (sprint goal):
    - The increment, or otherwise known as the sprint goal, is the end-product from a sprint
    - The definition of the sprint goal changes from team to team, as for some it means a product or features usable to customers by the end of the sprint, and for other teams, the end product is the completed part of a bigger project


### Scrum events/ceremonies
The scrum framework incorporates regular meetings, and events that teams perform regularly. In scrum, there are five regularly held events:
- Organization of backlog:
    - The responsibility of the product owner, they will make sure to continually update and maintain the product backlog, using user feedback and feedback from the devleopment team
- Sprint planning:
    - The user stories and/or bug fixes to be completed during the current sprint are planned during this meeting that includes the development team and is led by the scrum master
    - In this meeting a goal is decided upon and items from the product backlog are added in accordance to this goal
- Sprint:
    - This is a time period where the scrum team works together to complete items in the scope of the sprint, usually being two weeks
- Daily standup:
    - The standup is a regularly scheduled meeting in which members of the scrum team will update members on their progress and bring up and blockers they are facing with their work
- Sprint review:
    - This occurs at the end of the sprint, where the team meets to have an information session to demo the end-product and showcases the completed backlog items
- Sprint retrospective: 
    - Also occurs at the end of the sprint, the retro is where the team meets to discuss the aspects of the sprint that worked and did not work
    - This builds in feedback and continual improvement of processes in the scrum framework

### Why is scrum important?
The scrum framework is used so often since it provides an efficient and adaptable way to organize and manage teams and products. This being a team centric framework where teams are self managed and organized, it provides members to be more creative and innovative, having the flexibility to organize work based on their personalities and work styles. Scrum provides concrete roles, events, artifacts, principles and values to follow. These aspects of scrum can be incorporated into 301 project teams to stay focused and get the project done in the short amount of time we're given.
