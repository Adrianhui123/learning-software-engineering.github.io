## Introduction

This article will help users be able to get an idea of what Azure is, and how to get started with it to use with their own applications in personal projects, hackathons, assignments, or more! 

Azure is a [cloud service provider](#azure-terminology) by Microsoft that provides extensive services, including application hosting, messaging, data, storage, and more, for developers to leverage when building applications. 

It is one of the most popular [cloud service providers](#azure-terminology), and if you're an 18+ year old student, you can get $100 in Azure credit with the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). üòÅ

## Getting Started

Before being able to work with Azure, you must first create an account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/get-started/azure-portal). As mentioned earlier, after creating your account, you can get $100 in Azure credit with the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) if you're an 18+ year old student.

After creating an account, make sure you have an Azure subscription (such as Azure for Students above) to use.

## Installation

The Azure Portal is simple, and easy to use to interact with and create Azure services. Aside from your Azure account, no other setup is necessary.

For the examples in this article, you'll also require the Azure CLI. Instructions to install it on your computer can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 

Although not covered in this article, other alternatives for interacting with Azure can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/intro/azure-developer-create-resources).

While we won't be going into too much detail here, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed to follow along and get a basic Node.js web app with Express running (install Node.js and npm together for your system [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)). If you're working with another tech stack, links to help you find appropriate documentation and examples will be provided.

## Deployment

Azure application service allows you to build and host web applications, mobile backends and RESTful APL in the selected programming language without managing the infrastructure. It provides automatic scaling and high availability, supports Windows and Linux, and supports automatic deployment from GitHub, Azure Devops or any Git repository. You can refer to our quick start, tutorials and examples to learn how to use Azure application services.

## Azure Terminology

- **Cloud Service Provider**: An organization providing cloud services, such as storage, security, databases, and  applications, typically appealing for its flexibility to pay only for what you use. Examples include Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

- **Resource Group**: A logical grouping of resources, typically by application, so pretty much a box of resources (ex. databases, storage, app service) that are grouped together for a solution or application.

See other keywords in Azure's official [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/intro/azure-developer-key-concepts).
