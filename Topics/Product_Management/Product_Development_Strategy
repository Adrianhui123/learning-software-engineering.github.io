# What is a Product Development Strategy and Why is it Important?

When creating a new product as a product manager, the common stages involve organizing and overseeing cross functional teams through these stages of the product life cycle:

1. Identifying a product concept
2. Collecting data and feedback about the idea
3. Creating a MVP
4. Testing the product 
5. Launching the product 
6. Adjusting based on analytics 

A product development strategy is created by the product management team to be the step-by-step plans involved in propelling the product forward at each stage of its lifecycle. It also highlights the priorities, goals, and limitations of the project in order to set clear boundaries for the cross functional teams when questions arise. 

The PDS also takes into account factors such as market trends, user feedback, and competitive products to ensure the greatest product-market fit. 

Creating an informed product development strategy is critical to the success of the product because it aligns cross-functional teams around a shared set of priorities and goals. This will help these teams make better informed decisions when unexpected situations arise. For example if there is a predefined PDS in place, then when users are confused with a minor feature during the collecting feedback stage of the product life cycle, the design team will know to put that on hold in order to focus on a bigger feature given the time outlined in the PDS. Additionally, with the priorities that a PDS outlines, this allows for greater internal organization clarity, such as knowing which resources to allocate to what teams, and more accurate timeframe estimates. This in turn allows for more clear communication with external stakeholders such as the company leaders, clients, and partners. 

# Steps to Build a Product Development Strategy

Product development strategies will vary based on a variety of factors such as the company, industry, and purpose of the product being built. However, there are common steps across these divides which contribute to the success of the product in the market. 

1. Conduct Market Research 
2. Conduct Primary Research
3. Build a Prototype And Test the Product 
4. Launch the Product 

## Conduct Market Research

	An idea for a new feature or product may sound great in theory. However, to discover if there would be a real demand in the market, then effective market research must first be conducted to ensure true product-market fit. Conducting market research is the preliminary data gathering step, in which the product research team looks at existing data from sources to gain an understanding of the general user scope to find where the demand or pain points may lie.  

Common sources PM’s use include industry reports, statistics, and news articles, to find where their proposed new product may fit in the market. They then collect, aggregate, and form ideas from the data and put it in a centralized location so that the entire product team can access it and decide on the direction of the product. 

With many possible directions that a product can take, it is important for a product manager to choose a prioritization framework to streamline the decision making process and pick the most suitable features of a product to work on. A prioritization framework is designed to help teams make informed decisions about choosing which opportunities to pursue based on pre established business goals, product requirements, and constraints. 

A commonly used framework used in industry is the RICE framework. 

** RICE framework: **
Developed by Intercom to improve its own internal company decision making efforts, the RICE framework allows PMs to score each initiative, feature, or product they may consider pursuing according to the four factors: reach, impact, confidence, and effort. 

** Reach: ** Product managers first consider how many users their product will reach in a given time period. The terms ‘user’ and ‘time period’ can be defined differently based on the circumstances of the project. For example, users can refer to the number of free-trial signups or in app purchases made and the time period can be a month, a year, etc. 

The score will be the number of people you’ve estimated you will reach. If there were 1000 new signups in the course of a month, then the score is 1000.

** Impact: ** The impact of a product can be both quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative measures can be how many people have bought the new product, while qualitative measures can be measured in a self defined scale such as perceived increase in customer satisfaction.

The original scale developed by Intercom was out of 3 (being the biggest impact) and with 0.25 (being the lowest) 

** Confidence: ** So far, there can be a mixture of quantitative data to support the feasibility of a new product (such as with the Reach score) and scores where it is less data driven (such as the Impact score, when measuring customer satisfaction).  

The confidence score accounts for this and scales the overall project score by the team’s confidence in the viability of the project. 100% means high confidence, 80% means medium confidence, and 50% means low confidence. When the score is 50%, this usually means that the project has unrealistic objectives and can be put down in order to pursue other priorities. 

** Effort: ** The effort score accounts for the potential downsides of pursuing this project. Calculating an effort score is done by estimating the time needed to complete the idea. This timeframe can again be self defined based on the constraints of the team.  

RICE score = $ Reach \cdot Impact \cdot Confidence \div Effort $

Once the field is narrowed, the next stage of the Product Development can be conducted to help strengthen the existing ideas. 

## Conduct Primary Research 

Market research is important in using existing data to gain valuable insights to the general market. However to better validate the viability of your product before any financial and personnel commitment, it is critical to conduct your own first hand research to fill in any gaps that the broader research may have missed. 

There are many tools which can be used including feedback surveys, first-hand customer interviews, user tests, and focus groups. 

Keep in mind when conducting this primary source research that the questions should be simple and easy to answer in order to increase the response rate, and make consolidation and analysis of the data straightforward.

Some example questions that product managers have put on their feedback surveys and customer interviews are:

- How easy is this product to use? (1-10)
- Using this product helps me accomplish my goal (Agree/Disagree)
- What is your step by step process for using this product? 
- What do you dislike about the product? 

Once this first hand data is collected from the target user segment, product managers then can use the feedback to create a product specification sheet. ** Product specification ** is the detailed breakdown of responsibilities and features that each team is working on. With the input from the data collections, product managers with their teams can now know what to build and create the logistical plans for its implementation. 

While creating the product specification sheet, it is important to also choose the right performance metrics so that the features worked on in the development process can align to increase them. These metrics are known as ** KPIs ** (key performance indicators) and they measure the success of the product during development and after launch. 

There are three categories of KPIs product managers keep track of: business performance KPIs, customer and user engagement KPIs, and product development KPIs. 

** Business performance KPIs help PMs track the profitability of a product. ** Some indicators to look at are:

** Gross revenue: ** The total revenue created from product sales.

** Net revenue: ** Deduct the operating expenses from the revenue and what is left is the net revenue. This indicator gives a clearer sense of the product’s sales performance.  

** Gross margin: ** Is the amount of money retained after deducting the direct costs for producing the goods or services it sells. This indicator shows how efficient the production costs of a product are managed. 

Gross margin = Revenue - COGS / Revenue x 100

** Net profit margin: ** The ratio of profit a product earns to the total revenue (net sales) the product generates expressed as a percentage. This is a key indicator of the profitability of a product. 

Net profit margin = Revenue - Cost / Revenue 

** Customer and user engagement KPIs help monitor user loyalty, satisfaction, and retention. ** Some key KPIs in this category to monitor are:

** Conversion rate: ** Is the percentage of users who undertake a desired action (such as purchasing the product, signing up for an account, or clicking on a video)

Conversion rate = total conversions / total visitors x 100

** Customer acquisition cost (CAC): ** The cost acquiring a new customer. 

** Churn rate: ** The percentage of customers who stop using the product. 

Churn rate = Lost customers / Total customers at start of time period x 100

** Product development KPIs measure the efficiency and efficacy of the development lifecycle. ** These KPIs will help monitor that the development team is on track in an agile working environment. 

** Time to market: ** The total time (measured in days, weeks, or months) it takes to launch a product from its ideation to its testing and its deployment. 

** Defect density: ** The amount of bugs or issues in the product’s code divided by the total amount of code in the codebase. 

** Feature adoption rate: ** How fast users adopt the product’s new features. 

Feature adoption rate = Number of new feature users / Total number of feature users x 100

Choosing which KPIs to track should align with the company’s broader business goals such as increasing profitability in the next quarter by 10%. With the research conducted and strategic KPIs chosen for the product specification sheet, the next step in the product development strategy is to create the prototype.
